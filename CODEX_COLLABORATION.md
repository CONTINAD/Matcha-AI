# 🤝 Codex & Auto Collaboration Guide

## How We Work Together

You'll share Codex's output with me, and I'll:
1. Analyze what Codex did
2. Test if it works
3. Plan next steps
4. Give you prompts for Codex

---

## 📤 Sharing Format

When Codex does something, share it like this:

```
CODEX OUTPUT:
[Paste what Codex says it did]

CURRENT STATE:
- What's working: [list]
- What's broken: [list]
- What you tried: [list]

WHAT I NEED:
[What you want next]
```

---

## 📥 My Response Format

I'll respond like this:

```
ANALYSIS:
✅ What worked: [list]
❌ What needs fixing: [list]
💡 What I see: [observations]

TESTING:
[What I tested and results]

NEXT STEPS:
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]

FOR CODEX:
[Specific prompt for Codex to run next]
```

---

## 🔄 Workflow

```
You → Codex → [Codex output] → Me → [Analysis + Plan] → You → Codex → ...
```

**Example:**
1. You: "Codex, add charts to the dashboard"
2. Codex: "Added Recharts, created equity curve component..."
3. You: [Share Codex output with me]
4. Me: "Great! I see it added charts. Test it, then give Codex this: [next prompt]"
5. You: [Give prompt to Codex]
6. Repeat...

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Always test** after Codex makes changes
2. **Share errors** - If something breaks, tell me
3. **Be specific** - The more detail, the better
4. **Iterate** - We'll improve step by step

## 💬 Communication Tips

**Good:**
- "Codex added charts but they're not showing data"
- "The API works but frontend shows 'Failed to create strategy'"
- "Codex says it added auto-save but I don't see it working"

**Not as helpful:**
- "It's broken"
- "Doesn't work"
- "Fix it"

**Be specific!** The more detail, the better I can help.
